- Engineering Distributed objects for Cloud computing *(fundamental notion of cloud computing, its historical legacy and necessity, concepts and frameworks, developing highly performant, functional applications and deploying them on cloud environments)*
- Big Data Visualizations *(techniques and tools for  data management, analytics and visualization that enable creating visual systems from big data that enable domain experts in decision making in an interactive manner)*

More details about my coursework here.

### Personal:

- Learning PyTorch and Tensorflow
- Reading up on papers about machine learning, deep learning and algorithms
